# Fridgehunters
A web app created using React and an Express.js REST API to help users make food out of the items in their fridge using recommended recipes. Visit https://fridgehunters.now.sh/ to use the app! Currently in development with building and testing of new features.

This repository contains the Next.js React project along with server.js, which contains backend API code. Visit https://github.com/aseem191/Fridgehunters-Work-In-Progress to view the original rough repository for the project.
