# Fridgehunters
A web app created using React and an Express.js REST API to help users make food out of the items in their fridge using recommended recipes. Visit https://fridgehunters.now.sh/ to use the app! Currently in development with building and testing of new features.

This repository contains the Next.js React project along with server.js, which contains backend code.
